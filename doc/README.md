Welcome to the BrewPiLess wiki!

This project uses a single ESP8266 to replace RPI and Arduino.

BrewPi is the greatest, if not the ultimate, fermentation temperature controller. The original design uses a RPI to log temperatures and maintain a temperature schedule. The RPI also hosts a web server as the front-end of internet web access. 

ESP8266 is cheap and powerful WiFi-enabling IOT solution. Although it can't be as powerful as a RPI, it's a good solution to maximize the functionality and minimize the cost. Using a single ESP8266 as the temperature controller(replacing Arduino), web server and schedule maintainer(replacing RPI) also reduces the work in building a brewpi system.
